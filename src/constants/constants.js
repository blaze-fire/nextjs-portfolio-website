                  model behaviour (right now support only linear classifier models (LogisticRegression, SGDClassifier, LinearSVC), 
                  models which return coefficients after training.`,

                  You work at a leading social media platform and your team has been tasked to build a product recommendation

                  that classifies images based on elements within the picture. These elements should be related to decor or holiday 
                  season vacations, such as a snowman, a Christmas tree, flights, and the like.`,
